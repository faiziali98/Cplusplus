1. This folder contains three files:

	1. Simple pacman.	
	2. Hackers Mode.
	3. Hackers+Sound mode (I tried to do something different).

2. Kindy run Hackers+Sound mode in codeblocks, devc++ or visual studio because it uses <windows.h> library which is not contained in putty.

3. Also add winmm.lib to linker settings before running Hackers+Sound mode.

4. Please use maximized window of putty because the conditions are long and putty puts the part of them in the next line which gives errors.
